<h1>B-Trees</h1>

<pre>
B-Trees are used to reduce the height of a tree as you add to it i.e. making sure the tree is not "splindly." They are self-balancing trees

B-Trees of order L=2 are 2-3 Trees and B-Trees of order L=3 are 2-3-4 Trees (2-4 Trees).

2-3 Trees have at most 2 elements per node and at most 3 children per node.

2-3-4 Trees have at most 3 elements per node and at most 4 children per node.

Note: you can have other types of elements in your B-Tree such as letters or arbitrary objects (so long as these objects can be ordered).

Algorithm for searching for an element of a 2-3 Tree:
<ul>
  <li>(Similar to <b>searching</b> in a BST)</li>
  <li>Look at each node and determine which child to continur your search in </li>
  <ul>
  	<li>Repeat until element is found</li>
  </ul>

 Algorithm for <b>inserting</b> an element into a 2-3 Tree:
 <ul>
 	<li>Insert element into the leaf node that it should be added to</li>
 	<ul>
 		<li>If node is not full</li>
 		<ul>
 			<li>Add that element to the node</li>
 		</ul>
 		<li>If leaf node is full</li>
 		<ul>
 			<li>Split the elements of the full node plus the new element into two child nodes with the median of the three elements acting as the parent</li>
 			<li>If possible, add this element to the original parent node</li>
 			<li>If not possible, continue this splitting process upwards</li>
 			<li>If the process continues to the root node create a new node above the root</li>
 			<ul>
 				<li>Note: this is the only time where the height of the tree can be increased</li>
 			</ul>
 		</ul>
 	</ul>
 </ul>
</ul>
