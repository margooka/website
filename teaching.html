<h1>B-Trees</h1>

<p>
</br>B-Trees are used to reduce the height of a tree as you add to it i.e. making sure the tree is not "splindly." They are self-balancing trees
</br>B-Trees of order L=2 are 2-3 Trees and B-Trees of order L=3 are 2-3-4 Trees (2-4 Trees).
</br>2-3 Trees have at most 2 elements per node and at most 3 children per node.
</br>2-3-4 Trees have at most 3 elements per node and at most 4 children per node.
</br>Note: you can have other types of elements in your B-Tree such as letters or arbitrary objects (so long as these objects can be ordered).
</br>Algorithm for searching for an element of a 2-3 Tree:
<ul>
  <li>(Similar to <b>searching</b> in a BST)</li>
  <li>Look at each node and determine which child to continur your search in </li>
  <ul>
  	<li>Repeat until element is found</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

</br>Algorithm for <b>inserting</b> an element into a 2-3 Tree:
<ul>
 	<li>Insert element into the leaf node that it should be added to</li>
 	<ul>
 		<li>If node is not full</li>
 		<ul>
 			<li>Add that element to the node</li>
 		</ul>
 		<li>If leaf node is full</li>
 		<ul>
 			<li>Split the elements of the full node plus the new element into two child nodes with the median of the three elements acting as the parent</li>
 			<li>If possible, add this element to the original parent node</li>
 			<li>If not possible, continue this splitting process upwards</li>
 			<li>If the process continues to the root node create a new node above the root</li>
 			<ul>
 				<li>Note: this is the only time where the height of the tree can be increased</li>
 			</ul>
 		</ul>
 	</ul>
</ul> 
</br> Algorithm for <b>deleting</b> an element from a 2-3 Tree:
<ul>
	<li>(There are a few different algorithms)</li>
	<li>(It's hard)</li>
</ul>
</br><b>B-Tree Invariants</b> (things that are always true):
<ul>
	<li>All leaf nodes are the same distance from the root</li>
	<li>If a non-leaf node contains n elements, it has n+1 children</li>
	<li>Every node (other than the root) is at least half full</li>
	<li>>The root has at least two children as long as the height is &lt; 1</li>
</ul>

</br><b>Time Complexity:</b>
</br>Searching for a node: <b>O(logn)</b>
</br>Insertion: <b>O(logn)</b>
</br>Deletion: <b>O(logn)</b>
