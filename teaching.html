<h1>B-Trees</h1>
<p> B-Trees are used to reduce the height of a tree as you add to it i.e. making sure the tree is not "splindly." They are self-balancing trees
<br/> B-Trees of order L=2 are 2-3 Trees and B-Trees of order L=3 are 2-3-4 Trees (2-4 Trees).
<br/>2-3 Trees have at most 2 elements per node and at most 3 children per node.
2-3-4 Trees have at most 3 elements per node and at most 4 children per node.
<br/>Note: you can have other types of elements in your B-Tree such as letters or arbitrary objects (so long as these objects can be ordered).
