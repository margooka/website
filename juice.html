	<h1>Juice Ranking</h1>
	<p>My boyfriend, <a href="https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~joshuazlin/">Joshua Lin</a>, and I enjoy trying different juices. I'm using the term "juice" very broadly. Here is my current juice ranking:</p>
	<table style="width:100%">
	  <tr>
	  	<th>Rank</th>
	    <th>Type of Juice</th>
	    <th>Thoughts</th> 
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	  	<td>1</td>
	  	<td><img src="juice/binggrae_strawberry.jpg" height="100px"></td>
	  	<td><b>Binggrae Strawberry Milk</b> 
	  		</br>The perfect drink. It just tates really cute. Strawberry milk has always been the superior flavor of milk and anyone who says otherwise is a big dummy. In elementary school I would eat lunch and everyday I would choose to drink strawberry milk. Chocolate is overrated and unflavored milk is just boring. One day they stopped offering strawberry milk. I was really sad. Also my student ID for elementary through high school was 2166663. I thought it was cool that my lunch number had so many 6's in it. Other kids would always ask me "is that really your number" and I would reply "yes." I miss the inoccent days of my youth.</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>2</td>
	    <td><img src="juice/vitasoy_coconut.jpg" height="100px"></td>
	    <td><b>Vitasoy Coconut Soymilk</b> 
	    	</br>Absolutely delicious. The flavor is light and sweet. No complaints.</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	  	<td>3</td>
	  	<td><img src="juice/vitasoy_melon.jpg" height="100px"></td>
	  	<td><b>Vitasoy Melon Soymilk</b> 
	  		</br>Very novel flavor. It tastes very cute but like green.</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>4</td>
	    <td><img src="juice/yeos_lychee.jpg" height="100px"></td>
	    <td><b>Yeo's Lychee Juice</b> 
	    	</br>Nice delicate flavor. Tangy and Sweet. Very refreshing.</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	  	<td>5</td>
	  	<td><img src="juice/vitajuice_blackcurrant.jpg" height="100px"></td>
	  	<td><b>Vitajuice Blackcurrant Juice</b> 
	  		</br>Refreshing and enjoyable. Josh says it tastes just like "Ribena." I've never had "Ribena" but I assume it just tastes like normal grape juice which is what this tasted like.</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>6</td>
	    <td><img src="juice/vitasoy_malt" height="100px"></td>
	    <td><b>Vitasoy Malt Soymilk</b> 
	    	</br>I'm not really sure what "malt" is but this tastes pretty <strike>good</strike> okay. It has a very earthy flavor. It's a little weird though.</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	  	<td>7</td>
	  	<td><img src="juice/vitajuice_mango.jpg" height="100px"></td>
	  	<td><b>Vitajuice Mango Juice</b> 
	  		</br>I'm not a particularly big fan of mango nectar. It's too thick and sugary for me. This was just a standard mango nectar. Nothing particularly exciting.</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	  	<td>8</td>
	  	<td><img src="juice/vitajuice_sugarcane.jpg" height="100px"></td>
	  	<td><b>Vitajuice Sugar Cane Juice</b> 
	  		</br>This shit tastes like dirty grass water. I wasn't able to finish a single juice box. It was so disgusting??? How can anyone drink this???????</td>
